# CS1.0-Poetry-Slam
 Poetry slam assignment
For my Poetry Slam assignment, I chose a poem called It Couldn't Be Done by Edgar Albert Guest. I included three functions that print the lines of the poem in reverse, random order, and even lines only. I also included a menu where the user can choose how they want to read the poem from the three options available.
